= Pseudo-C

Translates a custom Lisp syntax (S-expressions) to C. The syntax is
designed to be a very light skin on top of C.

We should really specify a standard Lisp-to-C syntax instead of each
writing our own translators.

The program is written in portable Common Lisp and is ready to run
using CLISP. There is currently no documentation but the source is
mostly written as fairly readable macros.

Example:

```
(include-global "stdio.h")

(fun main ((argc sint) (argv (pp char))) => (sint)
  (var i sint)
  (printf "Arguments are:\n")
  (for (set! i 1) (< i argc) (inc! i)
    (printf "Arg #%d: %s\n" i (vref argv i)))
  (return 0))
```

To build it:

```
clisp pseudoc.lisp <hello.lisp >hello.c
cc -o hello hello.c
./hello
```
